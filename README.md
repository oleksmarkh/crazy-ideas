A list of things to think about.

## A grid extension for laying out front-ends

🔧

There might be many similar ones out there, and you don't need an extension to simply measure distance
(macOS: `⌘`+`⇧`+`4` followed by `ESC` without releasing a mouse).
But I dare to guess that there might not be an almost UI-less one that just shows a semitransparent resizable grid.

See:

* [Super-Powered Grid Components with CSS Custom Properties](https://css-tricks.com/super-power-grid-components-with-css-custom-properties)

## An extension that tracks requests destinations

🔬

* collect number of requests made to different domains
* compare the current one (origin) to externals
* render various charts (with d3 utils)
* re-playable "live" reports (based on persistent logs)
* blockers comparison (draw milestones when some blocker got installed/removed)

## An extension that measures time spent in active browser tabs

🔬

* completely client-side (no requests triggered from the extension, no tracking)
* collect:
  * "start/finish" timeframes (in active tab)
  * times a URL is entered, together with navigation within the domain (path-level gradation)
* display a summary and trends to showcase patterns (how much time is spent with which website)
* filtering and whitelisting (if only certain domains are interesting)
* grouping (productive, social, news, etc.)

## JS lib to run migrations

🔧

* timestamp comparison
* runner: orchestration
* migration: setup, teardown, up, down, validate

## Functional strategy game

🎮

* units - actors
* each unit type is configured with some predefined set of aspects
* units influence each other
* groups could gravitate the others
* different kinds of units: heavy, dynamic, robust, resilient etc.
* colors represent reactive interconnections

## Personal/family budget tracker

📊

* define categories/subcategories
* log (consider sort of a biweekly calendar)
* plan (place predefined amounts and recurring payments)
* biweekly/monthly graphs to observe trends
* [Sankey diagrams](https://s.dou.ua/storage-files/sanky3.png) for yearly reports, consider [`d3-sankey`](https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey)

## "Social disconnector" - a web service that organizes chosen subscriptions

🔭

Like Feedly, but for social media.
The idea is to eliminate noise by reducing time spent on native feeds,
having a list of accounts/tags you could explore just like RSS feeds.
That implies a need to be authorized by corresponding providers.

See:

* [Awesome OSINT: Social Media Tools](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint#social-media-tools)

## Pixel, turn-based game

🎮

* units - battleships (different in size and other params)
* one game move - select (one or more ships), shift to another area and fire (a target needs to be defined)
* damage depends on number and power of guns (sum of all guns on all selected ships)
* different guns have different effective areas, accuracy, damage power and (most importantly) - bullet limits
* ships have armour that can be damaged (instantly) and repaired (granularly, during game moves)
* each ship, gun and bullet costs something, depending on corresponding params
* a map is not fully visible - it's limited to areas close to player's ships
* damage is based on proximity - each shot looses precision with distance growing
* it's a multiplayer, but turn-based game - during each round every player defines a *move* and then all involved ships (of all players) execute those moves - they shift, fire, receive damage and eventually sink
* when ships of player A define a target among ships of player B, they should aim for the *upcoming* position of those B-ships, i.e. guessing a place where B would point the ships to
* number of players is not limited to 2, it starts from 1 (training mode with static targets) and can grow to some meaningful limit (e.g. 8)
* each turn is recorded, so after the battle the whole sequence could be restored as animated scene

## A map with annotated bicycle routes

🌍 🚴

* export routes from Strava and/or other sources
* an editor that enables custom annotations (left turns, traffic lights, trams, etc.)
* a map to display the routes
* sharable links (profiles, routes, selected areas)
* public profiles should be protected by a clear policy
* support for private segments
* replayable rides as videos/gifs (if imported data has timestamps for segments)

## Pixel font

🎨

* some characters are already used, see examples below
* inspired by [Mogee Font](https://github.com/kuzminadya/mogeefont/)
* see ["A beautifully illustrated glossary of typographic terms you should know"](https://www.canva.com/learn/typography-terms/) for terminology
